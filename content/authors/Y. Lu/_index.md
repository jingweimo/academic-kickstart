I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering (https://www.egr.msu.edu/bae) at Michigan State University (MSU). My research resolves around the development and deployment of non-destructive sensing (e.g., machine vision, optical imaging, and spectroscopy) and automation/robotics technologies for addressing pressing challenges in agricultural systems encompassing production and postharvest processes.

Before joining the faculty at MSU, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Mississippi State University during 2020-2022. I did my postdoctoral research on optical imaging for quality evaluation of horticultural products, and apple harvest-assist and in-field sorting technology development when with USDA-ARS at East Lansing, MI, and worked on several projects on imaging-based high-throughput plant phenotyping and precision agriculture while in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering at North Carolina State University. 

Fo prospective students who are interested in or determined to work with me, you need to be devoted, proactive, creative, and adaptive, while embracing challenges and aiming to go beyond your comfortable zone. Research is never trivial. I will strive my best to support you to fulfill your academic goals and enhance your profession and beyond.
