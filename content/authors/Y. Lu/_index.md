I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/bae" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering</a>  at Michigan State University (MSU). Before joining the faculty at MSU in January of 2023, I was a Postdoc scholar with <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/midwest-area/east-lansing-mi/sugarbeet-and-bean-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> USDA-ARS</a> on the campus of MSU for 2018-2019, focusing on optical imaging for quality evaluation of horticultural products and machine vision-based apple in-field sorting technology development (click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21SB9FJjf2M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). Thereafter, I joined in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering at North Carolina State University, with research on imaging-based high-throughput plant phenotyping and precision agriculture. I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Mississippi State University for 2020-2022. 

Welcome to join us at MSU! We are here to innovate in non-destructive sensing (e.g., machine vision, optical imaging, and spectroscopy) and automation/robotics technologies for addressing practical needs/challenges in agricultural systems encompassing production and postharvest processes. Our goal is to research, develop, and transfer engineering solutions for smart and sustainable agriculture & food systems, especially for specalty crop industries. For prospective students who are determined to work with me, you need to be devoted, proactive, creative, and adaptive, while being willing to go beyond your comfortable zone and embrace challenges. Research is never trivial but a real journey. I am excited to be on this journey with you. My goal is for you as a graduate student/postdoc to grow professionally and enjoy the process of becoming an expert in your discipline. I will strive my best to support you during your academic pursuits and enhance your profession and beyond. If you would like to have a glimpse of my personality, you may read some of my {{< staticref "media/写在求学路上__大学至研究生期间的零星记录.pdf" "newtab" >}} writings {{< /staticref >}} (written in Chinese 10+ years ago).
