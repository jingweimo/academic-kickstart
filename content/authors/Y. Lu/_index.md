I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering at Michigan State University (MSU) （https://www.egr.msu.edu/bae/）. My research resolves around the development and deployment of non-destructive sensing (e.g., machine vision, optical imaging, and spectroscopy) and automation/robotics technologies for addressing pressing challenges in the agriculture and food systems encompassing production and postharvest processes.

Before joining the faculty at MSU, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Mississippi State University during 2020-2022. I did my postdoctoral research on optical imaging for quality evaluation of horticultural products, and apple harvest-assist and in-field sorting technology development when with USDA-ARS at East Lansing, MI, and worked on several projects on imaging-based high-throughput plant phenotyping and precision agriculture while in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering at North Carolina State University.
