I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Mississippi State University. My research resolves around the development and deployment of non-destructive sensing (e.g., optical imaging and spectroscopy) and automation technology for addressing the pressing problems in the agricultural and food domain. After earning my doctorate, I worked for over 1 year for USDA-ARS at East Lansing, Michigan, on optical imaging for qualty evaluation of horticultural products, and apple harvest-assist and in-field sorting technology development, and later spent another year in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering at North Carolina State University on several projects on imaging-based high-throughput plant phenotyping and precision agriculture.
