I am actively looking for motivated PhD (and or MS) graduate students to start in Spring/Fall 2025 in the Department of Biosystems & Agricultural Engineering at Michigan State University. The student will be expected to conduct original research within the fields of sensing and automation for agriculture-food systems. Potential research topics include but are not limited to optical sensing or machine vision for quality assessment, grading, and sorting of horticultural produce and meat, in-orchard sensing & automation of specialty crop production, imaging-based high-throughput phenotpyping, and artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics for precision plant/animal production. Students with engineering backgrounds (e.g., agricultural/food engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, etc.) or relevant experience in computer vision and machine learning are highly welcome to apply. Please email me (luyuzhen@msu.edu) with your CV if you are interested.

In additon, I also have Postdoc positions focusing on harvest automation for specialty crops. The position can be started in Fall 2024/Spring 2025 (for an intial one year with possibility of extension). Qualifications for this position include demonstrated experience in machine/computer vision, hardware prototyping, sensors and control, system integration, and strong publication records in engineering journals.
