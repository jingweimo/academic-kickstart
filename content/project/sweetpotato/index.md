In this project, we will ollaborate with local sweetpotato packinghouses to enhance the efficiency and reduce human labor of packing operations by: 1) assessing the status of automation technology utilized in local sweetpotato packing lines and 2) designing and evaluating a machine vision technology-based inspection system for automatically grading and sorting sweetpotatoes for size, shape and defects. Research-based findings will be shared with stakeholders and the greater scientific community via field days, extension publications, peer-reviewed articles, electronic newsletters, webpages, and social media.
