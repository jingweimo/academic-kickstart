This proposed project aims to develop and deploy deep learning models for weed detection for cotton production systems. We will pursue three sub-objectives: 1) Collect and label new images of weed species in cotton fields across Mississippi and integrate images supporting robotic cotton harvest systems (mature bolls); 2) Develop and evaluate deep learning models for weed detection; 3) Deploy deep learning models on a machine vision prototype for in-field weed detection.
