In his project, we will ollaborate with local sweetpotato growers and packers to reduce mechnical impact during harvest and packing line operations by: 1) measuring impacts due to mechanical harvest and packing lines using an impact recording device, 2) quantifying visual damage on sweetpotato storage roots through image analysis, and 3) determining sweetpotato impact damage thresholds.
