This multi-state project aims to advance non-destructive optical technologies for enhanced quality evaluation, grading and sorting of sweetpotatoes. 
Specifically, this project will: 
1) develop computer algorithms for quantification and classification of appearance quality of sweetpotatoes using machine vision technology;
2) evaluate hyperspectral and interactance imaging for detecting internal quality, including firmness, soluble solids, dry matter, and internal defects of sweetpotatoes; 
3) develop and evaluate an automated sweetpotato grading and sorting machine prototype.
