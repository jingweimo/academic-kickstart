This research is to develop a large-scale, public image database of cotton weeds in the field and benchmark deep learning models for weed detection, with the ultimate goal to enhance computer vision-based robotic weeding for cotton. 
Three sub-objectives are to:
Objective 1: Acquire color images in the weed-infested cotton fields under natural light conditions at varied crop growth stages. 
Objective 2: Expand the image database algorithmically and annotate images for the weed instances at image and pixel levels. 
Objective 3: Provide benchmarking results of weed classification and detection for the image dataset using deep learning algorithms.
