Finding labor for vegetable weeding has become increasingly difficult and costs for manual weeding are escalating. To address the challenges, we propose to develop an innovative high-speed, high-precision automated weeding machine. The machine will utilize an artificial intelligence (AI) based imaging system to identify weeds and a precision sprayer to spot spray targeted weeds at the 1-cm level of resolution. The project was initiated and led by Dr. Mark C. Siemens at University of Arizona. We are collaborating on the field test and evaluation of the developed, AI-empowered smart sprayer for letter weeding.
