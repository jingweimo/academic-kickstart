Currently there is no commerical automation technology for infield sorting of apples. Although machine vision technology has been adopted for automated fruit sorting at packinghouses, critical challenges exist in developing machine vision systems for orchard application. To fail the gap, building upon previous research, this project aims to develop an AI (artificial intelligence) -enhanced multispectral vision-based in-field apple sorting system. Our long-range goal is to develop machine vision technology for commercial in-field grading and sorting of tree fruits.
