# abstract: Fish and fishery products are among the most important sources of nutritional components for human health, including high-quality proteins, essential vitamins, minerals, and healthy polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fish farming and processing technologies are continuously evolving to improve and enhance the appearance, yield, and quality of fish and fish products from farm to fork throughout the fish supply chain, including growth, postharvest, treatment, storage, transportation, and distribution. Processing of fish involves a period of food withdrawal, collection and transportation, the process of stunning, bleeding, chilling, cutting, packaging, and byproduct recycling. Cutting is a set of crucial operations in fish processing to divide the whole fish into smaller pieces for producing fish products (e.g., fish fillets, steaks, etc.). Various techniques and machinery have been introduced in the field to advance and automate cutting operations. This review aims to provide a comprehensive review of fish cutting techniques, machine vision and artificial intelligence applications, and future directions in fish industries. This paper is expected to stimulate research on enhancing fish cutting yield, product diversity, safety and quality, as well as providing advanced solutions for engineering problems encountered in the fish industry.
