abstract: In agricultural image analysis, optimal model performance is keenly pursued for better fulfilling visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, segmentation, object detection and localization), in the presence of challenges with biological variability and unstructured environments. Large-scale, balanced and ground-truthed image datasets are tremendously beneficial but most often difficult to obtain to fuel the development of highly performant models. As artificial intelligence through deep learning is impacting analysis and modeling of agricultural images, image augmentation plays a crucial role in boosting model performance while reducing manual efforts for image collection and labelling, by algorithmically creating and expanding datasets. Beyond traditional data augmentation techniques, generative adversarial network (GAN) invented in 2014 in the computer vision community, provides a suite of novel approaches that can learn good data representations and generate highly realistic samples. Since 2017, there has been a growth of research into GANs for image augmentation or synthesis in agriculture for improved model performance. This paper presents an overview of the evolution of GAN architectures followed by a first systematic review of various applications in agriculture and food systems (https://github.com/Derekabc/GANs-Agriculture), involving a diversity of visual recognition tasks for plant health conditions, weeds, fruits (preharvest), aquaculture, animal farming, plant phenotyping as well as postharvest detection of fruit defects. Challenges and opportunities of GANs are discussed for future research.
